# Camera-App
A flash camera, zoom and no ads.

For both picture taking and video recording, the camera is available. You can switch between the front and the rear camera, change the save direction, and restrict the resolution. It is possible to turn the flash on and off or use it as a flashlight. You can zoom in and out in a pinch.

You might have to disable the built-in Camera app in Settings -> Applications -> Camera -> Disable if you want to open this app by pressing the hardware camera button.

No advertising or unwanted permissions are included.
